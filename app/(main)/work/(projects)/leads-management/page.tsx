                    Leads is a software solution designed to help businesses organise and manage their sales leads throughout the customer acquisition process. It typically includes tools for capturing, storing and tracking interactions with potential customers and analysing the data received to help sales and marketing teams make informed decisions.
                    The system allows businesses to streamline their sales processes, increase efficiency, improve lead conversion rates, and ultimately boost customer relations.

                    We&apos;re creating Leads to help marketing and sales teams easily access prospect data from one place. Before proceeding with the final designs, I must determine if the product is comprehensible and beneficial to users. I would also like to understand what specific challenges users might face while using the Leads prototype and how I can combat these issues before building it.

                    I conducted an informal moderated usability study with 6 participants from 18th April to 28th April 2023. This test aimed to determine if users can complete the core tasks within the product efficiently and whether or not they understand the interface and its processes.
                    Each session lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. Participants were given the same tasks to complete and questions to answer. All participants generally found the product user-friendly, easy to navigate and straightforward.
