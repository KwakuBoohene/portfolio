                I created this user flow to help me and my team navigate the core functions of recording a sales and generating invoices on our app. It&apos;s important to note that the app is primarily designed for viewing/tracking information rather than fulfilling  actions. Therefore, this user flow, which focuses on sales and invoices, stands as the most significant journey within the app.
