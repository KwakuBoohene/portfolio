                One thing about me: I love to work on challenging projects, especially those new to me. The stress is definitely there, but the sheer determination to see a project through is stronger and always wins, and that&apos;s how we got here: the exciting task of transforming a desktop/web app into a functional mobile prototype. This experience highlighted the power of collaboration and the immense value in refining designs through iteration. My big takeaway was that design processes aren&apos;t linear; hence, it&apos;s essential to adopt an approach that is efficient for you and helps you get the work done. Amidst the challenges, two stood out to me: 1. simplifying information presentation to reduce cognitive load and prevent an overcrowded interface and 2. trying not to oversimplify the user experience and bore users. This experience was a tightrope, but I was glad to learn and improve my UX and UI skills.

                    My task was to design a functional mobile app that helps users track inventory data and sales data, point of sale, manage staff members and view reports. The primary objective of this app is to provide users with unparalleled convenience, allowing them to interact with crucial inventory data and perform specific functions without being confined to a desktop environment. It was important to consider the needs and preferences of the business and its audience while designing to ensure both sides were happy and comfortable with the outcomes.
